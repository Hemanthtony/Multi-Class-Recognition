Multi-Class Animal Recognition
This project aims to build a machine learning model capable of recognizing multiple classes of animals based on their images. The goal is to train a classifier to correctly identify and classify various animals into categories like cats, dogs, elephants, lions, and more.

The project uses deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to handle image classification tasks. This model is designed to recognize a diverse set of animals and can be easily adapted to include new classes or be fine-tuned for better performance.
